<!-- Add this within your HTML body, after the previous sections -->
<h2>When do we use customer information from third parties?</h2>
<p>We receive some information from third parties when you contact us. For example, when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming our customer, we receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to us. We also occasionally collect information that is made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</p>

<h2>Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</h2>
<p>We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with third parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and others who provide our content or whose products or services we think may interest you. We may also share it with our current and future affiliated companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale, or other business reorganization, we may also share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to our successors-in-interest.</p>
<p>We may engage trusted third-party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and our service, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service, and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through our service. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you.</p>
<p>We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the service in a shared location, and the type of device used to visit the service. They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the service and then provide auditing, research, and reporting for us and our advertisers.</p>
<p>We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules, and regulations.</p>

<h2>Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?</h2>
<p>We will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.</p>

<p>By submitting your email address on our service, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to
    people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer
    audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information
    and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed
    unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email</p>
    <!-- Continue with the rest of your Privacy Policy sections as HTML headings and paragraphs -->

    <h2>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h2>
    <p>We are incorporated in South Africa. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed
        and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans- border transfer and
        hosting of such information.</p>
  
    <h2>Is the information collected through our service secure?</h2>   
    <p>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are
        foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes
        any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p> 

<!-- Add this within your HTML body, after the previous sections -->
<h2>Can I update or correct my information?</h2>
<p>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies. Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Update or correct your personally identifiable information.</li>
  <li>Change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us.</li>
  <li>Delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change, or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed, or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p>

  <li>Change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us.</li>

<p>Such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change, or deletion.</p>

<h2>Sale of Business</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of us or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion of us or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization, or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<!-- Main content of your Privacy Policy continues here -->
<!-- Add these sections within your HTML body, after the previous sections -->
<h2>Affiliates</h2>
<p>We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
<p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>

<!-- Main content of your Privacy Policy continues here -->
<!-- Add the "Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)" section within your HTML body, after the previous sections -->
<h2>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>

<p>We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy, we are going to explain exactly how and why this data is collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>

<h3>What is GDPR?</h3>
<p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control that EU residents have over their personal data.</p>

<h3>What is personal data?</h3>
<p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own or in combination with other pieces of information to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
  <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfill a specific purpose and should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
  <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfill its purpose.</li>
  <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Add the "Why is GDPR important?" and "Individual Data Subject's Rights" section within your HTML body, after the previous sections -->
<h2>Why is GDPR important?</h2>
<p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breaches. Beyond these facts, it's simply the right thing to do. At Gracewell Methodist Church, we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important, and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>

<h2>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability, and Deletion</h2>
<p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Gracewell Methodist Church processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p>
<p>We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve, and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self-service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers' data. Our customer support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.</p>
